# Express
A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is used to create web applications and APIs simply and efficiently.

# Body-parser
A middleware used to parse the body of HTTP requests in Node.js applications, making it easier to access data sent by the client.

# Bcrypt
A cryptography library used for password hashing. It is commonly used in web applications to securely store passwords.

# Cors
Short for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, it is a middleware that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from a different domain than the one that originated the resource itself.

# Dotenv
A tool that allows loading environment variables from a .env file in Node.js applications, making it easier to configure development environments.

# Gridfs-stream
A package that allows using MongoDB's GridFS to store and retrieve binary files (e.g., images, videos) in Node.js applications.

# Multer
A middleware for Node.js used to handle multipart/form-data file uploads. It is often used in web applications to allow users to upload files.

# Multer-gridfs-storage
A storage for Multer that allows uploading files directly to MongoDB's GridFS.

# Helmet
A set of middleware that helps protect Express applications by automatically configuring various security-related HTTP headers.

# Morgan
An HTTP logger middleware for Node.js used to log HTTP requests received by the application.

# Jsonwebtoken
An implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Node.js. It is used for authentication and authorization in web applications, allowing users to obtain secure access tokens after successful authentication.

# Mongoose
A Node.js library that provides a data modeling layer for working with MongoDB. It is used to simplify interaction with MongoDB, offering features such as schema validation, data type conversion, and simplified queries.
